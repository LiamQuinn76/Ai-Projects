This repository contains three AI projects that I created to deepen my understanding of how neural networks are fundamentally built and trained. 
The projects include the implementation of backpropagation, a simple classification network, and a reinforcement learning agent. 
Each project is built from scratch, using either numpy or PyTorch, to explore the inner workings of neural networks.
